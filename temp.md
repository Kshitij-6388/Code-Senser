❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum() { return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:

* ❌ Undeclared variables: The variables `a` and `b` are used without being declared. This will result in a
`ReferenceError` in most JavaScript environments (strict mode).
* ❌ Lack of parameter definition: The function doesn't specify what inputs it expects. This makes it unclear how to use
the function and reduces code readability.
* ❌ No error handling: The function doesn't handle potential errors, such as non-numeric inputs.
* ❌ Missing return type: While JavaScript is dynamically typed, specifying the return type (e.g., using TypeScript)
improves code clarity and maintainability.


✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new Error('Inputs must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Added parameters `a` and `b` with type annotations (using TypeScript). This clarifies the expected input types.
* ✔ Included error handling to check if the inputs are numbers. Throwing an error prevents unexpected results.
* ✔ Specified the return type as `number`.
* ✔ Improved readability and maintainability. The function is now self-documenting and easier to understand.


Further Considerations:

* For larger projects, consider using a linter (like ESLint) and a type checker (like TypeScript) to automatically catch
these kinds of errors.
* Explore functional programming concepts for potentially more robust or elegant solutions depending on the context of
the larger program. For example, using array methods might make sense if you need to sum elements of an array.
