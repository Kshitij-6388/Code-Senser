# AI-Powered Code Editor

An AI-powered code editor built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This web application allows developers to write, edit, and get intelligent suggestions and code completion through artificial intelligence, improving productivity and code quality.

## Features

- **Code Editing**: Write code with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Receive real-time code suggestions and improvements powered by AI.
- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Auto-complete your code with relevant suggestions based on context.
- **Code Formatting**: Automatically format your code to ensure consistent coding style.
- **Syntax Error Detection**: Get instant feedback on syntax errors and suggested fixes.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark and light modes for a better coding experience.
- **Responsive Interface**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user preferences, code snippets, and project data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface, including the code editor.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment to run server-side code and manage backend APIs.
- **AI Integration**: Use of AI models (such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT models) for code suggestions and improvements.
